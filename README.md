## ___Hotel Reservations Cancellations___
Dataset: Kaggle

Model: Random Forests (Binary Classification)

Objective: Predict hotel
reservations cancellations & feature importance

Accuracy: 89%

Remarks: High classification accuracy with important features being lead time, no. of special request and average price per room.

## ___Poker Hands___
Dataset: Kaggle

Model: RNN & LSTM (Multi-class Classification)

Objective: Predict Poker Hand Class (e.g. Royal Flush)

Accuracy: RNN - 87% & LSTM - 70%

Remarks: Dataset has 'Imbalance Class' problem. A simple RNN model has a better classification accuracy than LSTM.
