## ___Hotel Reservations Cancellations___
Dataset: Kaggle

Model: Random Forests (Binary Classification)

Objective: Predict hotel
reservations cancellations & feature importance

Accuracy: 89%

Remarks: High classification accuracy with important features being lead time, no. of special request and average price per room.

## ___Poker Hands___
Dataset: Kaggle

Model: RNN & LSTM (Multi-class Classification)

Objective: Classify Poker Hand Class (e.g. Royal Flush)

Accuracy: RNN - 87% & LSTM - 70%

Remarks: Dataset has 'Imbalance Class' problem. A simple RNN model has a better classification accuracy than LSTM.

## ___Fashion MNIST___
Dataset: Keras

Model: Convolutional Neural Network (Multi-class Classification)

Objective: Predict fashion category of image

Accuracy: 92% (Average 5-fold cross validation)

Remarks: High classification accuracy coupled with L2 regularization

## ___Wiconsin Breast Cancer___
Dataset: University of California

Model: Decision Trees (Classification)

Objective: Prediction of tumor to be malignant or benign and interpretability/explainability of Decision Tree Model

Accuracy: 94% (Average 10-fold cross validation)

Remarks: High classification accuracy with features 'Uniformity of Cell Size', 'Clump Thickness' and 'Marginal Adhesion' being primary attributes for high predictive accuracy.
